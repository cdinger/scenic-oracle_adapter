# scenic-oracle_adapter

An Oracle adapter for the [scenic](https://github.com/scenic-views/scenic) rubygem.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'scenic-oracle_adapter'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

You'll need to tell the scenic gem to use this adapter in an initializer:

```ruby
# config/initializers/scenic.rb

Scenic.configure do |config|
  config.database = Scenic::Adapters::Oracle.new
end
```

## Development

While you can use any Oracle instance for development, it's easiest to use Docker and docker compose.

Note that the Oracle container takes up to two minutes to start and become available. If you're doing active development you probably want to start the containers in detached mode: `docker compose up -d`. This starts everything in the background and allows you to use `docker compose exec` to run commands on the already running containers:

- Run specs: `docker compose exec gem bin/test`
- Open a console: `docker compose exec gem bin/console`

## Tests

If you just want to run the test suite you can use `docker compose run --rm gem bin/test`. Again, because the Oracle container takes so long to start up, the first execution will take a while. The test suite will wait for the database container to become available. Subsequent executions will be faster.

By default, the test suite will attempt to connect to a local docker Oracle instance (see `spec/spec_helper.rb` for connection details).
You can override the database URL by supplying a value to the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable.
